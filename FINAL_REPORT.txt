3. THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU FACED (5 POINTS)
================================================================================

Problem 1: Alpha Vantage API Premium Feature Error
---------------------------------------------------

When: December 15, 2025 (during initial data collection)

What happened: The initial code used outputsize='full' parameter to get 
complete historical data. The API returned an error message saying this is 
a premium-only feature.

Why it was a problem: Could not collect stock data, blocking progress on the 
entire project.

How I solved it: Changed the parameter from outputsize='full' to 
outputsize='compact', which returns the last 100 days of data and is available 
on the free tier. This was sufficient for the project requirements.

Result: Successfully collected 100 rows per stock. No further API errors.


Problem 2: Duplicate String Data - Stock Symbols
-------------------------------------------------

When: December 15, 2025 (during database verification)

What happened: After collecting stock data, I inspected the database and 
discovered that stock symbols "NVDA", "AMD", and "COIN" were each stored 
100 times (once per row = 300 duplicate TEXT strings total). The project 
requirements explicitly state "You must not have duplicate string data in 
your database!"

Why it was a problem: Would lose significant points on the grading rubric 
for having duplicate strings.

How I solved it:
  1. Created a new lookup table called stock_symbol with integer primary key
  2. Inserted each stock symbol only once into stock_symbol table
  3. Changed stock_price table structure from symbol (TEXT) to stock_id 
     (INTEGER foreign key)
  4. Updated all functions to use get_stock_id() to retrieve integer IDs
  5. Deleted the old database and recollected all stock data with the new 
     schema

Result: Each stock symbol now stored only once. Zero duplicate strings.


Problem 3: Duplicate String Data - Dates
-----------------------------------------

When: December 15, 2025 (during comprehensive database audit)

What happened: After fixing stock symbols, I did a thorough check and 
discovered dates were stored as TEXT strings like "2025-12-15". Since we have 
3 cryptocurrencies and 3 stocks, each date appeared 6 times in the database, 
resulting in hundreds of duplicate date strings.

Why it was a problem: Would lose significant points for duplicate strings, 
violating project requirements.

How I solved it:
  1. Changed date column type from TEXT to INTEGER in all tables
  2. Created date_string_to_int() function to convert "2025-12-15" to integer 
     20251215
  3. Created date_int_to_string() function to convert back to string format 
     for display
  4. Updated collect_crypto_data.py to convert dates before inserting
  5. Updated collect_stock_data.py to convert dates before inserting
  6. Updated analyze_data.py to convert dates back to strings for output
  7. Deleted old database and recollected all 775 rows with integer dates

Result: All dates now stored as integers. Zero duplicate date strings.


Problem 4: Visualization Date Formatting
-----------------------------------------

When: December 15, 2025 (during visualization creation)

What happened: After implementing integer dates, the price movement chart 
showed x-axis labels as raw numbers like "600, 700, ... 2.25e7" instead of 
actual dates.

Why it was a problem: Visualization was unreadable and unprofessional.

How I solved it:
  1. Imported datetime module in visualize_data.py
  2. Created a date mapping dictionary to convert integer dates to Python 
     datetime objects before plotting
  3. Used matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter to format x-axis labels
  4. Used matplotlib.dates.AutoDateLocator for proper date spacing

Result: X-axis now displays properly formatted dates like "2025-06-19", 
"2025-07-15", etc.


Problem 5: API Rate Limiting
-----------------------------

When: December 15, 2025 (during stock data collection)

What happened: Alpha Vantage free tier has rate limits of 5 calls per minute 
and 25 calls per day. Without delays, the script would hit rate limits and 
fail.

Why it was a problem: Could not collect data efficiently.

How I solved it: Implemented automatic 12-second delays between API calls in 
collect_stock_data.py using time.sleep(12). This ensures we stay under the 
5 calls per minute limit.

Result: Successfully collected all stock data without hitting rate limits.

4. THE CALCULATIONS FROM THE DATA IN THE DATABASE (5 POINTS)
================================================================================

Screenshot of Calculation Results
----------------------------------

Below is the output from output/analysis_results.txt showing calculations 
performed on data retrieved from the database using SQL JOINs:


CROSS-MARKET CORRELATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Findings from Calculations:
--------------------------------

1. Strong correlation between cryptocurrencies and Coinbase stock (COIN):
   • BTC-COIN: 0.6496
   • ETH-COIN: 0.6521
   This makes sense because Coinbase's business depends on crypto trading.

2. Coinbase (COIN) is the most volatile asset:
   • 4.86% average daily volatility
   • Even more volatile than cryptocurrencies ETH (2.73%) and BTC (1.46%)

3. AMD showed the highest single momentum spike:
   • +45.98% price increase over 7 days in October 2025

4. Bitcoin (BTC) is the least volatile asset:
   • 1.46% average daily volatility
   • More stable than all stocks analyzed


================================================================================


5. THE VISUALIZATIONS THAT YOU CREATED (5 POINTS)
================================================================================

Visualization 1: Price Movement Chart
--------------------------------------

File: output/visualizations/price_movement_chart.png

[INSERT IMAGE: price_movement_chart.png HERE]

Description:
  • Type: Dual-axis line chart
  • Left y-axis: Cryptocurrency index values (normalized to base 100)
  • Right y-axis: Stock index values (normalized to base 100)
  • X-axis: Dates (properly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD)
  • Shows price movements for all 6 assets over time
  • Different colors and line styles for each asset:
    - BTC: Orange solid line
    - ETH: Purple dashed line
    - SOL: Cyan dash-dot line
    - NVDA: Green solid line
    - AMD: Red dashed line
    - COIN: Blue dotted line

How this goes beyond lecture examples:
  • Uses dual y-axis (twinx) which was not covered in lectures
  • Normalizes all prices to base 100 for comparison
  • Custom color scheme for each asset
  • Proper date formatting on x-axis


Visualization 2: Correlation Heatmap
-------------------------------------

File: output/visualizations/correlation_heatmap.png

[INSERT IMAGE: correlation_heatmap.png HERE]

Description:
  • Type: Seaborn heatmap
  • Shows correlation between all cryptocurrency-stock pairs
  • 3 rows (BTC, ETH, SOL) × 3 columns (AMD, COIN, NVDA) = 9 correlations
  • Color gradient:
    - Red = Negative correlation
    - Yellow = Neutral (near zero)
    - Green = Positive correlation
  • Each cell shows the correlation coefficient (3 decimal places)
  • Values range from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive)

How this goes beyond lecture examples:
  • Heatmap visualization type was not covered in lectures
  • Uses Seaborn library (not just basic matplotlib)
  • Shows statistical correlation matrix
  • Custom colormap (RdYlGn - Red-Yellow-Green)


Both Visualizations Saved As:
------------------------------
  • PNG format (not just displayed)
  • High resolution (300 DPI)
  • Located in output/visualizations/ directory
  • File sizes: price_movement_chart.png (692 KB), 
    correlation_heatmap.png (172 KB)


================================================================================


6. INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING YOUR CODE (5 POINTS)
================================================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Install Python 3.x (project tested with Python 3.12)

2. Install required libraries:

   pip install requests matplotlib seaborn


Step-by-Step Instructions
--------------------------

OPTION 1: Using Interactive Menu (Recommended)
-----------------------------------------------

Run this command:

   python3 main.py

Then follow the menu prompts:

   1. Choose option 1: Initialize Database (run ONCE at the start)
   2. Choose option 2: Collect Cryptocurrency Data (run 4-5 times)
   3. Choose option 3: Collect Stock Data (run 4-5 times)
      Note: Each stock data run takes 30-40 seconds due to API rate limits
   4. Choose option 4: Check Progress (verify you have 100+ rows per source)
   5. Choose option 5: Run Analysis
   6. Choose option 6: Create Visualizations
   7. Choose option 0: Exit


OPTION 2: Manual Execution (Step-by-Step)
------------------------------------------

Step 1 - Initialize Database (run ONCE):

   python3 database_setup.py

   Expected output:
   • "Database tables created successfully!"
   • Creates crypto_stock_analysis.db file


Step 2 - Collect Cryptocurrency Data (run 4-5 times):

   python3 collect_crypto_data.py

   Expected output for each run:
   • "Total rows inserted: 25" (or fewer if reaching limit)
   • Shows count of rows for BTC, ETH, SOL

   Why run multiple times:
   • Each run stores maximum 25 rows total
   • Need 100+ rows per cryptocurrency
   • 4-5 runs will collect sufficient data


Step 3 - Collect Stock Data (run 4-5 times):

   python3 collect_stock_data.py

   Expected output for each run:
   • "Total rows inserted: 25" (or fewer if reaching limit)
   • Shows count of rows for NVDA, AMD, COIN
   • Takes 30-40 seconds (includes automatic 12-second delays for API limits)

   Why run multiple times:
   • Each run stores maximum 25 rows total
   • Need 100+ rows per stock
   • 4-5 runs will collect sufficient data


Step 4 - Run Analysis:

   python3 analyze_data.py

   Expected output:
   • "Analysis complete!"
   • Creates output/analysis_results.txt
   • Shows number of records loaded from database


Step 5 - Create Visualizations:

   python3 visualize_data.py

   Expected output:
   • "Visualization creation complete!"
   • Creates output/visualizations/price_movement_chart.png
   • Creates output/visualizations/correlation_heatmap.png


Verification
------------

After completing all steps, verify you have:

   • crypto_stock_analysis.db (database file, ~30 KB)
   • output/analysis_results.txt (text file with results, ~2-3 KB)
   • output/visualizations/price_movement_chart.png (~600-700 KB)
   • output/visualizations/correlation_heatmap.png (~170-180 KB)


Important Notes
---------------

• Each data collection script enforces 25-row limit automatically
• NO code changes needed between runs
• Duplicates are automatically detected and skipped
• All dates stored as integers to avoid duplicate strings
• Alpha Vantage collection is slower due to API rate limits (12-sec delays)


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you get "Database not initialized" error:
   → Run python3 database_setup.py first

If you get "Not enough data" error during analysis:
   → Run collection scripts more times to gather 100+ rows per source

If you get "Module not found" error:
   → Install missing library: pip install [library-name]
